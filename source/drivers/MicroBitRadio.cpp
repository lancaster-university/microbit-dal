/**
  * Provides a simple broadcast radio abstraction, built upon the raw nrf51822 RADIO module.
  *
  * The nrf51822 RADIO module supports a number of proprietary modes of operation in addition to the typical BLE usage.
  * This class uses one of these modes to enable simple, point to multipoint communication directly between micro:bits.
  *
  * TODO: The protocols implemented here do not currently perform any significant form of energy management,
  * which means that they will consume far more energy than their BLE equivalent. Later versions of the protocol
  * should look to address this through energy efficient broadcast techniques / sleep scheduling. In particular, the GLOSSY
  * approach to efficient rebroadcast and network synchronisation would likely provide an effective future step.
  *
  * TODO: Meshing should also be considered - again a GLOSSY approach may be effective here, and highly complementary to
  * the master/slave arachitecture of BLE.
  *
  * TODO: This implementation may only operated whilst the BLE stack is disabled. The nrf51822 provides a timeslot API to allow
  * BLE to cohabit with other protocols. Future work to allow this colocation would be benefical, and would also allow for the
  * creation of wireless BLE bridges.
  *
  * NOTE: This API does not contain any form of encryption, authentication or authorisation. Its purpose is solely for use as a
  * teaching aid to demonstrate how simple communications operates, and to provide a sandpit through which learning can take place.
  * For serious applications, BLE should be considered a substantially more secure alternative.

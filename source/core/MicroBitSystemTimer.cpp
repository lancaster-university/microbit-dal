/**
  * Definitions for the MicroBit system timer.
  *
  * This module provides:
  *
  * 1) a concept of global system time since power up
  * 2) a simple periodic multiplexing API for the underlying mbed implementation.
  *
  * The latter is useful to avoid costs associated with multiple mbed Ticker instances
  * in microbit-dal components, as each incurs a significant additional RAM overhead (circa 80 bytes).

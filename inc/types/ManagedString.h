/**
  * Class definition for a ManagedString.
  *
  * Uses basic reference counting to implement a copy-assignable, immutable string.
  *
  * This maps closely to the constructs found in many high level application languages,
  * such as Touch Develop.
  *
  * Written from first principles here, for several reasons:
  * 1) std::shared_ptr is not yet availiable on the ARMCC compiler
  *
  * 2) to reduce memory footprint - we don't need many of the other features in the std library
  *
  * 3) it makes an interesting case study for anyone interested in seeing how it works!
  *
  * 4) we need explicit reference counting to inter-op with low-level application langauge runtimes.
  *
  * 5) the reference counting needs to also work for read-only, flash-resident strings

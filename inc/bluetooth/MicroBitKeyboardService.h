/**
  * This class represents a Bluetooth HID device, specifically, a keyboard instance.
  *
  * A few things to note:
  *     - HID devices require a battery service (automatically instantiated with this class)
  *     - Security is required, this class has only been tested using Just Works pairing.
  *     - On mac to get it to pair, you may have to interrogate a secure characteristic of the micro:bit via LightBlue
  *       in order to initiate pairing.
  *     - It is designed to be as light weight as possible, and employs tactics like the stack allocation of
  *       gatt characteristics to alleviate RAM pressures.

  * @author Alex King
  * @date 6 Mar 2016
  *
  * @brief API for POSIX-like file system interface: open/close/read/write.
  *
  * -- Basic overview of how the file system works:
  * All file meta data is stored in the first page. Each file has a record
  * entry (struct FileTableEntry_t), which stores:
  *  - Filename
  *  - File size
  *  - An ordered list of pages/blocks that store the file data itself.
  *
  * The table housing these records is referred to as the File Table (FT)
  * and looks something like this:
  *  {"file1.txt",   5000,   {1,2,3,6}}  // 5000-byte file, in blocks 1,2,3,6
  *  {"file02.txt",   200,   {5}}        // 200 byte file in a single block
  *
  * The first FT entry is reserved, and is used only to store a list of
  * currently available blocks for writing.
  * Thus to expand a file size, a block must be removed from this list, and
  * added to that files blocklist.
  *
  * Since there can only be one FT, the number of entries is restricted
  * to how many can fit in a single flash page. Hence, this is the
  * maximum number of files that can be stored.
  *
  * The filesize is stored in the FT, but cached in the mb_fd struct.
  * Writes to the FT filesize are made sparingly in write() and close(), to
  * reduce erasures.
  * @warning close() *must* be called to ensure the FT is synched, before
  * the microbit is finished.
  *
  * -- API overview.
  * Source code is divided logically into two parts:
  * ft_*() functions - to access and modify the FT entries.
  *                    E.g., to create a new file, change a files size,
  *                    or append new blocks to the file.
  *                    These are private methods internal to the class.
  *
  * read/write/seek/remove - POSIX-style file access functions.
  *                          These are the methods used to interact with the
  *                          file system.
  *
  * Example:
  * @code
  * MicroBitFileSystem f;
  * int fd = f.open("myFile.txt", MB_WRITE|MB_CREAT);
  * if(fd < 0) {
  *   print("couldn't open a new file");
  *   exit;
  * }
  * if(f.write(fd, "Hello, World!\n",14) != 14) {
  *   print("error writing!")
  *   exit
  * }
  * f.close(fd);
  * @endcode
  *
  * -- Notes
  * - There should exist only one instance of this class.
  * @todo implement simple wear levelling for file data writes.
  * @todo implement MB_APPEND flag in open()
